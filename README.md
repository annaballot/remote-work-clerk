Ever wanted a coffee while working from home but didn't want to miss important calls?

This IOT device helps remote workers by notifying them of a Teams call or notification when they are downstairs taking a well deserved break. It also monitors the temperature in the home office and reminds the worker to open the window for fresh air, to help with concentration.
